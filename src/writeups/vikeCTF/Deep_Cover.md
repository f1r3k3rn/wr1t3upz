As the Viking ship sailed across the vast North Sea, its crew encountered unexpected turbulence in the form of a message. Amidst the rugged expanse of the waters, a messenger bird descended, bearing a weather report inscribed in Cyrillic script. With furrowed brows, the Norsemen deciphered the ominous tidings, seeking the hidden meaning within.

we have a file where a cypher is applied let'see :

I want the writeup to be understandable even by those who are just starting out. So I will try to explain it simply
We have a cyphertext where we can see that there is something that is similar to the flag cbufMHG{6d5hbao_7k_50_US_t3z_r0dz} 

what we can do ? 

**try a bunch of stuff on cyberchef or dcode**

why?

because when u are in a situation like this one it's a lot of **guessing the cipher** ,Soooo my steps were these:

1. rot13
2. vigenere with this key ZFNYMHFN
3. **monoalphabetic substitution cypher**

the 3th was the right path ,i suggest [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) to attack these types of challenges , now it's ez we copy paste the ciphertext in to decode ,click on decrypt automatically  and we have the full plain text.

it s obv that this is not the right flag we need to respect upper/lower case letters and substitute the X with v :

```
flag: vikeCTF{6u5ting_7O_50_KM_p3r_h0ur}
